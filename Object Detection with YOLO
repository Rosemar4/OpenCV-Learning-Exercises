📌 Project: Basic Object Detection with YOLOv8

This project is part of my basic exercises on OpenCV and Computer Vision.
It demonstrates real-time object detection using the YOLOv8 model (yolov8.pt), capable of detecting persons and 80 COCO dataset classes (e.g., cars, chairs, bottles, etc.).

🔹 Key Features

Implemented YOLOv8 with Python and OpenCV

Detects people and other objects from webcam/video/images

Bounding boxes with labels and confidence scores

Lightweight beginner project for practicing object detection

🔹 Technologies Used

Python 🐍

OpenCV 🎥

Ultralytics YOLOv8

🔹 How to Run

Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/basic-yolo-object-detection.git
cd basic-yolo-object-detection


Install dependencies

pip install ultralytics opencv-python


Run detection

python detect.py


👉 This repo is mainly for learning and experimentation as I build my skills in computer vision and deep learning.
